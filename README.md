# MLOps Pipeline

This repository contains a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a machine learning project. The pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying a machine learning model and its associated dataset.

## Project Overview

The MLOps Pipeline project aims to streamline the development, testing, and deployment of machine learning models by leveraging various tools and technologies. The pipeline incorporates code quality checks, unit testing, containerization, and automated notifications to ensure a smooth and efficient workflow.

## Tools and Technologies

The following tools and technologies are used in this project:

- **Git** for version control
- **GitHub** for hosting the project repository
- **GitHub Actions** for implementing CI/CD workflows
- **Jenkins** for building and deploying Docker containers
- **Docker** for containerizing the application
- **Python** and **Flask** for developing the machine learning application
- **Flake8** for code quality checks
- **Unit testing framework** (e.g., pytest, unittest)

## Pipeline Overview

The CI/CD pipeline consists of the following stages:

1. **Code Quality Checks**: Whenever changes are pushed to the `dev` branch, a GitHub Actions workflow runs `flake8` to ensure code quality and adherence to best practices.
2. **Unit Testing**: When a pull request is created from the `dev` branch to the `test` branch, a GitHub Actions workflow triggers automated unit tests to verify the correctness of the code.
3. **Containerization**: Upon merging changes into the `master` branch, a Jenkins job builds a Docker image for the application and pushes it to Docker Hub.
4. **Notification**: After the successful completion of the Jenkins job, an email notification is sent to the administrator.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/Wajahat1769/MLOps-Pipeline-Streamlining-ML-Model-Deployment.git`
2. Install the required dependencies (e.g., Python packages, Docker, Jenkins).
3. Configure the CI/CD workflows and Jenkins job according to the project's documentation.
4. Develop your machine learning model and application in the `dev` branch.
5. Follow the established branching strategy and collaboration workflow to contribute to the project.
